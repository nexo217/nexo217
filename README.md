 ### Hi there, I'm Sten, aka Nexo! 👋

I'm currently 15 years old and I have a passion for game development using Unity.

- 🎮 I mainly work with Unity and its API (C#).
- 🕹️ My GitHub primarily showcases the games I've developed.
- 🚀 I'm currently part of a game development team called Styxcon, where around 20 young enthusiasts like me collaborate voluntarily. [Styxcon](https://linktr.ee/styxcon)
- 💡 I'm currently working on a 1v1 online math battle game.
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord at: [nex.o](https://discord.com/users/615596676375380008)

Feel free to explore my repositories and check out the projects I've been working on. If you'd like to collaborate or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me!

Happy coding! 🚀
